# ollama-sandbox

A Docker Compose setup to run Ollama on a local workstation. 

This project leverages Docker containers to create a stand-alone environment for running Ollama, ideal for running open source LLM models (example: Deepseek, qwen2, llama). 

The setup includes multiple services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- **ollama**: This service runs the main Ollama container. It uses the `ollama/ollama` image and exposes port `11434` for communication.

- **ollama-ubuntu**: This service builds a custom Docker image from the `dockerfile.models` . It installs necessary dependencies and the Ollama tool. The service is responsible for pulling the machine learning models listed in `models.txt` and storing them in a shared volume. It depends on the `ollama` service and runs a command to pull the models upon startup.

- **open-webui**: This service runs the Open WebUI container, which provides a web interface for interacting with Ollama. It uses the `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main` image and exposes port `3000` for accessing the web UI.
